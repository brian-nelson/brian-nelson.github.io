## Printrbot Simple Metal - Spool Hanger Upgrade

I started having issues with the spools on my 3d printer getting stuck in the screws that hold it to the body.  I was designing a part that I could print, and also found some on thingiverse, but realized that I could make a far simpler fix.  I drilled a 3mm hole through the center of the metal support and then put a 3mm bolt and a few nuts on it to keep the spindle from rotating into the screws.

I also recently broke the original Ubis 13 print head.  I purchased the newer Ubis 13s head and have it installed.  I still need to get the fan and shroud for it installed.  The shroud is printed, and fan on order.
